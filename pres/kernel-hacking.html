    <h2>What is a kernel?</h2>
	<p>
		A kernel is the part of the operating system which is usually a passive
		layer between the hardware and anything the system may need.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the kernel is done initializing itself it hands control over to
		user level applications and after this only runs on behalf of a user level
		process or software interrupt, or on behalf of a hardware request.
	</p>
	<p>
		For some people the kernel is the only protection the hardware has from the user.
		Normally it's the other way around, the kernel provides an interface to the hardware
		that allows a generic interface through which a user and user space applications
		can make use of those resources.
	</p>

<section class="slide" id="exp">
    <h2>What experience do I need to work on the kernel?</h2>
	<h3 class="slide">Next to none!</h3>
	<ol class="slide">
	        <li>
		    <h3>Knowledge of data types</h3>
			<p>Example: int, long, byte, etc...</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		    <h3>Basic structures (in C)</h3>
			<p>How to access members of a structure (either by reference or value)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		    <h3>How to read and follow code</h3>
			<p>Reading and understanding code written by other people</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Any C-like language experience</h3>
			<p>This includes Java, C#, C++, etc..</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="kernel-org">
    <h2>Cool where do I start?</h2>
	<ol>
	    <li class="slide">
		    <h3>Get the kernel sources</h3>
			<p>Kernel.org, Linus Torvald's Github</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Read the sources</h3>
			<p>
				Folders are self describing (mm = memory management, include = I hope I don't
				have to explain this one, etc..). Try to avoid the arch folders as they contain
				architecture specific information that you probably don't care about.
				
				Most of the high level implementation is human readable to a certain extent if you're
				familiar with the data structures since there's no architecture specific code involved
				or assembly (at least there shouldn't be....)
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class = "slide">
			<h3>Learn the data structures</h3>
			<p>
				Located in the root source include folder. Most of them are actually implemented
				directly in the header files as macros and inline functions. You can learn a lot
				about GCC tricks and pointer arithmetic here.
				
				Favorite example is the list_entry method which uses pointer arithmetic to get
				the original structure using only a pointer to the list_head structure within
				that structure.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="learn">
	<h2>More Advanced Things to Look At</h2>
	<ol>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Kernel Memory Management</h3>
			<p>
				Memory allocation schemes, SLUB and SLAB. The kernel needs to manage its internal structures somehow right?
				It's malloc for the kernel (kmalloc).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Basic OS Concepts</h3>
			<p>
				Virtual memory management, Scheduling, Kernel/Process context, System calls, Block Device I/O,
				Kernel modules, Device drivers.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="whatcanido">
	<h2>That's nice but what can I do?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Work on Kernel related projects</h3>
			<p>
				The android kernel is built using a custom linux kernel, which is open source.
				For those that have an HP Touchpad, the CyanogenMod version of Android for it
				is also open source which means you can work on it if you want to see something
				implemented for it.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Apply custom patches to improve performance</h3>
			<p>
				Every once in a while you may see kernel patches floating around the net
				that promise increased performance of certain applications, but maybe your
				particular distro hasn't caught up yet or doesn't support that kernel version
				in their package repository.
				
				You could always apply the patch and compile it yourself and install it.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Learn how your system works</h3>
			<p>
				Learn by taking things apart if you will. Ever wondered what happens when you press a key
				on your keyboard? When you try to save a file to an external drive? Find it in the code.
				
				Maybe you'll figure out a better way to do things.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="compiling">
	<h2>Compiling the Kernel</h2>
	<ol>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Make a configuration file</h3>
			<p>
				<pre>make menuconfig</pre> Gives you an interactive menu to select certain
				features for your kernel (debugging settings, drivers, filesystems, etc...)
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Build the kernel</h3>
			<p>
				Ahh, the beauty of make <pre>make</pre> now just kick back and wait.
				
				On multicore systems use <pre>make -j #of cores + 1</pre> to use
				multithreaded compilation to make it go faster.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="compiling2">
	<h2>Compiling the Kernel cont...</h2>
	<ol>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Install drivers</h3>
			<p>Again make, makes life easier <pre>make modules_install</pre> (might require sudo in some distro's).</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>The rest of the steps are distribution specific</h3>
			<p>
				Depending on your distribution you're just about done here (such as Gentoo). For
				Ubuntu this requires a bit more work and usually requires updating grub entries and creating
				an initial RAM filesystem.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="conc">
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<ol>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Play around with the kernel</h3>
			<p>
				Try changing some stuff and see what happens (usually bad things).
				
				Poke around and see why things are done or just how they work.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Work on open source kernel project</h3>
			<p>
				One of the most popular ones right now (besides the kernel itself) as I mentioned
				before is the CyanogenMod version for the HP Touchpad. Involves writing mostly drivers
				and driver related code as the kernel is robust enough if you build something for
				it to sit on, it just works.
				
				Porting Linux to random devices seems to be something that people want to do
				and people are willing to get behind.
				
				Plenty of projects on Github related to Linux.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="slide">
			<h3>Just learn</h3>
			<p>
				Heck if all else fails, you hopefully learned something about operating systems or 
				operating systems development.
			</p>
		</li>
